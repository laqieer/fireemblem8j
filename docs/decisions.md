# Decision log

## D1 — Next phase: per-function-run porting (not whole-file-only)

**Date context:** after 10 whole-file TUs (~0.01%), a 12-file batch ported 0/12 —
larger files don't match as whole units because one region-different function (or
one unmasked placement-dependent byte) poisons the whole-file masked signature.

**Consulted:** Copilot CLI (`agency cp`). Its recommendation: prioritize
**per-function porting** over more whole-file masking — whole-file matching is
all-or-nothing; per-function isolates the differing function, turning "0/12
files" into "most functions matched, a few flagged," and yields a precise queue
for region-specific decompilation.

**Validation (done before committing to it):**
- `-ffunction-sections` with agbcc: REJECTED. It accepts the flag and emits
  per-function `.text.<fn>` sections, but concatenation/placement adds alignment
  that shifts bytes; not usable for byte-matching.
- **Source-level run splitting: VALIDATED.** Compiling a subset `.c` containing
  only a contiguous run of functions (e.g. NextRN+InitRN) produces those
  functions byte-for-byte identical to the JP ROM (`0xB60..0xC0C`), *provided*
  baseline-resident calls (memcpy, __modsi3, …) are declared as typed-Thumb
  symbols so the linker emits direct BL with no interwork veneer. (A first test
  wrongly suggested literal-pool coupling; that was veneer bytes from untyped
  test symbols — corrected.)

**Decision:** adopt **per-function-run porting** as the next-phase architecture:
1. For a target file, get each function's JP match status (match_us_jp +
   per-function locate).
2. Group consecutive *matching* functions into contiguous JP runs.
3. For each run, compile a subset `.c` (the run's functions only) and carve it at
   the run's JP range; non-matching functions stay in the incbin baseline,
   exposed as typed baseline symbols.
4. Genuinely region-different functions become the queue for behavioural JP
   decompilation (the old option #3).

Targeted masking improvements (jump tables / `.rodata`) are done only as needed
to support per-function location — not as a standalone whole-file-perfection phase.

**Status:** validated; implementation pending (extend locate_tu/port_tu to
per-function granularity). Tracked on project board #14.

## D2 — Runs must be verified as a compiled block (not trusted per-function)

**Date context:** per-function-run porting (D1) worked for small runs (time: 2
fns) but failed for bmtrick's 18-fn run — the compiled subset matched JP for ~5
functions then shifted (871 diffs). Root cause: per-function masked search gives
individually-unreliable matches (small functions get false-positive unique hits
that still pass the source→JP monotonicity filter), so the grouped "run" isn't a
true JP-contiguous block.

**Consulted:** Copilot CLI. Recommendation (adopted): the unit you carve is a
linked block, so the unit you *trust* must also be a linked block. Per-function
matches are proposals only.

**Decision (D2):** the carve primitive is **compile-and-verify-the-block**:
1. Propose candidate functions via per-function masked search.
2. Form a candidate run (consecutive matched functions, source order).
3. Compile the subset `.c` and masked-search its WHOLE emitted `.text` for a
   UNIQUE match in the JP ROM.
4. Only carve if the block uniquely matches, at the matched JP base.
5. On no/!unique match, find the longest matching prefix (binary search on the
   function count), carve that, recurse on the remainder.

Rule: **never carve a run unless the compiled block has a unique masked ROM
match.** This makes the porter self-validating; false runs auto-shrink to real
verified runs. ROM-resident `.data`/`.rodata` placement (D1 follow-up) layers on
top once the `.text` block is verified.
