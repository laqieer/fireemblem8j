## D1 — Next phase: per-function-run porting (not whole-file-only)

**Date context:** after 10 whole-file TUs (~0.01%), a 12-file batch ported 0/12 —
larger files don't match as whole units because one region-different function (or
one unmasked placement-dependent byte) poisons the whole-file masked signature.

**Consulted:** Copilot CLI (`agency cp`). Its recommendation: prioritize
**per-function porting** over more whole-file masking — whole-file matching is
all-or-nothing; per-function isolates the differing function, turning "0/12
files" into "most functions matched, a few flagged," and yields a precise queue
for region-specific decompilation.

**Validation (done before committing to it):**
- `-ffunction-sections` with agbcc: REJECTED. It accepts the flag and emits
  per-function `.text.<fn>` sections, but concatenation/placement adds alignment
  that shifts bytes; not usable for byte-matching.
- **Source-level run splitting: VALIDATED.** Compiling a subset `.c` containing
  only a contiguous run of functions (e.g. NextRN+InitRN) produces those
  functions byte-for-byte identical to the JP ROM (`0xB60..0xC0C`), *provided*
  baseline-resident calls (memcpy, __modsi3, …) are declared as typed-Thumb
  symbols so the linker emits direct BL with no interwork veneer. (A first test
  wrongly suggested literal-pool coupling; that was veneer bytes from untyped
  test symbols — corrected.)

**Decision:** adopt **per-function-run porting** as the next-phase architecture:
1. For a target file, get each function's JP match status (match_us_jp +
   per-function locate).
2. Group consecutive *matching* functions into contiguous JP runs.
3. For each run, compile a subset `.c` (the run's functions only) and carve it at
   the run's JP range; non-matching functions stay in the incbin baseline,
   exposed as typed baseline symbols.
4. Genuinely region-different functions become the queue for behavioural JP
   decompilation (the old option #3).

Targeted masking improvements (jump tables / `.rodata`) are done only as needed
to support per-function location — not as a standalone whole-file-perfection phase.

**Status:** validated; implementation pending (extend locate_tu/port_tu to
per-function granularity). Tracked on project board #14.
